    "### Punycode\n",
    "Punycode is a way of encoding internationalized domain names (IDNs) that contain non-ASCII characters, such as accented letters or characters from non-Latin alphabets (e.g., Chinese, Arabic). It converts these characters into a standardized ASCII format so they can be processed by the Domain Name System (DNS), which traditionally only supports ASCII characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**: The domain name \"münchen.de\" (Munich in German) would be converted to \"xn--mnchen-3ya.de\" in Punycode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In phishing detection, Punycode is relevant because attackers may use lookalike characters from different languages (e.g., replacing \"o\" with \"ο\" from the Greek alphabet) to create URLs that appear legitimate to users but actually lead to malicious sites. This technique is called homograph spoofing and is a common tactic in phishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `shortening_service`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `shortening_service` feature indicates whether the URL uses a link-shortening service, like bit.ly, tinyurl.com, or goo.gl. URL shorteners create short, obfuscated links that redirect to a longer URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In phishing detection, this feature is essential because shortened URLs can hide the true destination of a link, making it easier for attackers to disguise malicious websites. Phishing schemes frequently use shortened URLs to deceive users into clicking on links that appear harmless but lead to fraudulent sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prefix sufix\n",

    "Regular Expression Pattern: `r\"https?://[^\\-]+-[^\\-]+/\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "This regular expression pattern is designed to identify URLs that follow a specific structure. Here’s a breakdown of each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `https?`: Matches either `http` or `https` at the beginning of the URL.\n",
    "- `://`: Matches the literal `://` that follows `http` or `https`.\n",
    "- `[^\\-]+`: Matches one or more characters that are **not** a hyphen (`-`).\n",
    "- `-`: Matches a hyphen character within the URL.\n",
    "- `[^\\-]+`: Again matches one or more characters that are **not** a hyphen (`-`).\n",
    "- `/`: Matches a forward slash at the end of the specified segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "This pattern will match URLs that start with `http` or `https`, followed by `://`, and contain a subpath segment with text that includes a hyphen surrounded by non-hyphen characters (e.g., `abc-xyz`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Matches\n",
    "- `http://example.com/abc-xyz/` will match.\n",
    "- `https://domain.com/a-b/` will match.\n",
    "- `http://site.com/abc/` will **not match** because it lacks a hyphen in the segment after the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This regular expression is useful for identifying URLs that contain directory structures with hyphens in specified segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Report\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is designed to detect potentially suspicious URLs based on known patterns within the URL structure or by resolving specific IP addresses associated with phishing or spam. It operates through two primary checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **URL Pattern Matching**: \n",
    "   - The function verifies if the URL contains any known suspicious domain patterns, such as `at.ua`, `usa.cc`, or `baltazarpresentes.com.br`. \n",
    "   - If any of these patterns are found within the URL, it flags the entry as potentially risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **IP Address Pattern Matching**:\n",
    "   - The function attempts to resolve the domain's IP address using `socket.gethostbyname()`.\n",
    "   - It then checks if this IP address matches any from a predefined list of known malicious IP addresses. \n",
    "   - If the IP address matches one of these, the URL is flagged as suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values:\n",
    "- **`1`**: The URL is flagged as suspicious due to either matching a risky pattern or an associated IP address.\n",
    "- **`0`**: The URL does not match any suspicious patterns or IP addresses.\n",
    "- **`2`**: An exception occurred (e.g., if the IP resolution fails), indicating an unresolved case.\n",
    "\n",

    "### `domain_registration_age`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `domain_registration_age` feature calculates the number of days remaining until the domain's expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- This feature queries the domain's WHOIS data to retrieve its expiration date.\n",
    "- It then compares this expiration date with the current date and returns the number of days left before the domain expires.\n",
    "- If no expiration date is available, the function returns `0`, indicating that the domain's registration length could not be determined.\n",
    "- If there is an error fetching the information, the function returns `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### `domain_registration_length`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `domain_registration_length` feature performs two checks: one for domain name validation and another for domain expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- The feature first verifies whether the domain name matches the WHOIS-recorded domain name. If there is a mismatch, it assigns `1` (indicating potential inconsistency).\n",
    "- Then, it retrieves the expiration date from WHOIS records and calculates the number of days left until the domain expires, similar to the first feature.\n",
    "- If no expiration date is found, it returns `0`.\n",
    "- The function returns two values: \n",
    "  - `v1`: A flag indicating if the domain name matches the WHOIS-recorded domain name (`0` for match, `1` for mismatch).\n",
    "  - `v2`: The number of days left until the domain expiration or `-1` if no expiration date is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature adds a layer of verification for domain name consistency along with the expiration date calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Domain after copyright logo (Shirazi'18), `domain_with_copyright`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature checks whether the domain name appears near a copyright (©), trademark (™), or registered (®) symbol in the content of the webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- The function searches for copyright (©), trademark (™), or registered (®) symbols in the webpage content.\n",
    "- It then checks if the domain name appears within a range of 50 characters before or after the symbol.\n",
    "- If the domain appears near one of these symbols, it returns **0** (indicating no issue).\n",
    "- If the domain does not appear near the symbol, it returns **1** (indicating a possible issue).\n",
    "- If no copyright, trademark, or registered symbol is found, it defaults to returning **0**.\n",

    "## Percentile of Safe Anchor: URL_of_Anchor in Zaini'2019 (Kumar Jain'18)\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature calculates the percentage of unsafe anchor links in the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In web development, anchors refer to HTML elements used to create hyperlinks. An anchor (<a> tag) allows users to click on a link and navigate to another location, which could be another webpage, a different section within the same page, a downloadable file, or an external URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: <a href=\"https://example.com\">Click here</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The function calculates the total number of anchor links classified as \"safe\" and \"unsafe.\"\n",
    "- It then computes the percentile of \"unsafe\" anchors relative to the total number of anchors.\n",
    "- If there are no anchors or all anchors are classified as safe, the function returns **0**.\n",
    "- The result is the percentage of unsafe anchors compared to the total anchors on the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unique Values:\n",
    "- **0**: No unsafe anchors or no anchors at all.\n",
    "- **Percentage**: A float representing the percentage of unsafe anchors, ranging from **0 to 100**.\n",
